                <p>In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Goods were purchased in the last 7 days</li>
                    <li>The Goods are in the original packaging</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following Goods cannot be returned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
                <h1 class="text-left">Returning Goods</h1>
                <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods at the following address:</p>
                <p>all</p>
                <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return
                    delivery.

                <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
